# NLP-misogynist project

# Background: 
The website Urban Dictionary is criticised for hosting content which are defined as "misogynistic, hate speech and racism". A group of researchers collected data from the website and labelled them as either misogynistic or non-misogynistic. 

Source: "Data set for automatic detection of online misogynistic speech" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919305773)

# Objective: 
From the data set, we will train a ML model for NLP text classification. The definitions will be classified as either misogynistic or non-misogynistic.

# Required libraries:
Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud, STOPWORDS, scikit-learn (sklearn).

# Others
